Space invader: Asteroid closer than moon zooms past Earth
Earth got an unwelcome visitor Wednesday when an asteroid as massive as Egypt’s Great Pyramid of Giza zipped closer to us than the moon.

Actually, three asteroids flew within hailing distance of the planet Wednesday morning, but 2019 OD was the closest, crossing Earth’s orbit at a relatively scant 222,164 miles away — or about 17,000 miles closer than our moon, according to NASA.

At its greatest point, the asteroid is 393 feet wide and was hurtling through space at an extraordinary 43,000 mph.

Despite its massive size, 2019 OD wasn’t large enough to be viewed through a telescope, according to Live Science. But even if it somehow managed to penetrate Earth’s atmosphere, it wouldn’t be gigantic enough to cause critical devastation.

“If you look at the consequences, (asteroids) could be enormous. We’re talking about potential city killers, impacts that can wipe out an entire continent or even cause civilization to collapse. But the probability is extremely low. It’s the classic low-probability, high-consequence problem,” University of New Mexico professor of Earth and planetary sciences Mark Boslough told Gizmodo. “I don’t spend a lot of time worrying about it.
The two other asteroids, 2019 OE and 2015 HM10, were considerably further away; 2019 OE was just over 600,000 miles away at its closest point to Earth while the other was about 3 million miles out.

Two telescopes located 100 miles away on Hawaii — known collectively as ATLAS — scan the cosmos for potential asteroids capable of striking Earth, reported CNN
