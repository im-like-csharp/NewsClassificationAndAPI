Southeast Reno mosquitoes test positive for West Nile Virus
RENO, NV (KOLO)-- Mosquitoes captured in the Hidden Valley and Rosewood Lake areas tested positive for West Nile Virus, the Washoe County District Health Department said Wednesday. No human cases have been reported.

The health department will do early morning insect fogging Thursday in the Hidden Valley and Rosewood Lakes areas.

People are asked to report night-time mosquito activity to the health department by calling 775-328-2434.

The virus is most commonly spread through mosquito bites. Four out of five people who have the virus do not develop any symptoms, the health department said. About one in five with the virus have mild symptoms such as headache, body aches, joint pains, vomiting, diarrhea or rash. Most people with this type of disease recover completely, but fatigue and weakness can last for weeks or months.

About 1 in 150 people who are infected develop a severe illness affecting the central nervous system such as encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) or meningitis (inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord).

The health department recommends people wear proper clothing and repellent if going outdoors in early morning or early evening, when mosquitos are most active. These repellents are safe: DEET, Picaridin, IR3535, Oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), Para-menthane-diol (PMD) and 2-undecanone.

Other health department tips:



Make sure that your doors and windows have tight-fitting screens to keep mosquitoes out. Repair or replace screens with tears or holes.

Clear areas around your home of any free-standing water that may become a mosquito breeding-ground, including small puddles, pools, planters, childrenâ€™s sandboxes, wagons or toys, underneath and around faucets, as well as plant saucers and pet bowls; and

Vaccinate horses for WNV.
