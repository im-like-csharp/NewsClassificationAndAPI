GARETH FULLER/PA
Sage Group stumbled this morning after the FTSE 100 software group revealed a sharp drop in software sales.

The company’s software licence revenues fell by 15.5 per cent to £195 million in the first nine months of the year. Executives bemoaned the underperformance of its X3 software licences and services.

Its shares fell 12 per cent, or 99p, to 717¼p in early trading.

The FTSE 100 enjoyed a strong start to the day, however, rising 14 points or 0.19 per cent to 7,515.6 as updates from Astrazeneca, the pharmaceutical giant, and Compass, the catering company, impressed the City.

Astrazeneca advanced 337p or 5.3 per cent to £66.96. Compass gained 54 or 2.8 per cent to £20.19.
