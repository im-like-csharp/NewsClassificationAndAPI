Here's How to File Your $125 Equifax Claim
(NEWSER) – Think you might be due some of the hundreds of millions being doled out to victims of the Equifax breach? It's time to file a claim. Consumers affected by the 2017 security snafu who are eligible to make a settlement claim—you can find out if that includes you by using this tool, which asks for your last name and the last six digits of your Social—can apply for either 10 years of free credit monitoring or a one-time $125 cash payment, per USA Today. If you suffered serious losses as a result of the breach, you can apply for a cash payment of up to $20,000, which is meant to compensate you for such expenses as attorney costs, losses from unauthorized charges, and the fees associated with freezing your credit report.

Finally, if it felt like a job taking time out of your life to deal with the mess, the settlement has cash available to pay out an hourly rate—$25 per hour for up to 20 hours, Forbes reports. Consumers who want to file a claim can either call 1-833-759-2982 or email info@EquifaxBreachSettlement.com for a form that can then be mailed back, or head to https://www.equifaxbreachsettlement.com/ to complete an online form, where all you have to do to get started is plug in some basic info like name, address, and year of birth. The deadline to file is Jan. 22 of next year; payouts will begin Jan. 23 "at the earliest," per the Federal Trade Commission. (Read more Equifax stories.)
