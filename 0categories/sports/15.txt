Liverpool might have beaten Tottenham Hotspur in last month's Champions League final but the Reds now find themselves trailing behind Mauricio Pochettino's side after Spurs signed up to the third-most lucrative shirt sponsorship deal in the Premier League.

The North London outfit announced a new eight-year deal with AIA, one of the world’s leading life insurers, on Thursday thought to be worth around £360million.

Believed to be the third biggest deal in the top-flight behind Manchester United and Manchester City, Tottenham's new £45million-a-season agreement is worth more than Liverpool's own current deal with shirt sponsors Standard Chartered.
The Reds currently bring in £40million per season, the same value as Chelsea and Arsenal's current deals, through an amendment to the parties' existing agreement in May last year.

Manchester United currently boast a £51million a year shirt sponsorship deal with Chevrolet which may well mean Liverpool, armed with their new status as European champions, believe they can - and should - be picking up an annual fee closer to the Red Devils' own commercial deal.

Liverpool are already looking to agree a lucrative new kit deal as their current agreement with New Balance draws to a close next summer, again look to seek parity with their North West rivals' £75million-a-year deal with Adidas.
And such a viewpoint will have only been heightened across the board by Tottenham's latest deal after Spurs stumbled to a fourth place finish in the Premier League last season as they reached a maiden Champions League final.

In contrast, the Reds' European Cup final appearance against Tottenham was their second-successive Champions League final appearance while they missed out on the Premier League title by the narrowest of margins to Manchester City.
With Jurgen Klopp's side continuing to go from strength-to-strength on and off the pitch, with the Champions League trophy tucked under their arm and an overall £1billion valuation , the club are well-placed to expect record-equalling deals at least when heading to the negotiating table.
