NEWCASTLE OFFERED FREE AGENT TRIO – SHOULD THEY MAKE A MOVE
Newcastle have been offered a move for free agents Andy Carroll, Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck according to the Chronicle.

The three former England forwards are all out of contract this summer, and could be available on a cut price deal for Newcastle.

The Magpies recently completed a move for Brazilian striker Joelinton, with Newcastle paying over £40 million to sign the Hoffenheim striker.
However, Newcastle still lack depth, with Dwight Gayle and Yoshimuro Muto the only other strikers at the club.

Therefore, they could make a move for on of the three former England internationals, who could add some great depth to the Toon.

Carroll could be reunited with Newcastle, after starting his career with the club before moving to Liverpool for over £30 million back in 2011. 

Sturridge and Welbeck could also be a good option for Newcastle, with the pair both having good goalscoring records in the past.

However, all three have struggled with injuries in past seasons, so signing them for depth could be an issue.

According to the report, Newcastle could be unlikely to move due to wage issues with Sturridge and Welbeck, with the duo likely to ask for high wages.
