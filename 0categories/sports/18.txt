Nicolas Pepe's agent breaks silence on Man Utd transfer links with 'terms agreed'
The agent of Manchester United target Nicolas Pepe has taken to social media to issue an update on the Lille forward's future.

The Ivorian international is set to leave the French side this summer after an impressive notching 22 goals for his club last term.

That form has earned the 24-year-old a host of admirers from across Europe, with Liverpool and Arsenal having previously been linked with the forward.

United, though, seemed to have taken the lead in the race to sign the former Angers attacker for a rumoured fee of around £70m.

It was thought the Premier League club were closing in on a move for Pepe, but his agent Samir Khiat took to Twitter to deny his client was on the verge of joining the Red Devils.
Khiat posted a picture of a tweet from Yahoo Sport France and highlighted a part that claimed Pepe had agreed personal terms with United, captioning the whole thing 'Fake News'.
That would seem to cast doubt on the 23-year-old imminently joining United, though he could still make the move to Old Trafford this summer.

With Romelu Lukaku being linked with a £75m move to Inter Milan, the Red Devils would be on the lookout for an attacker and would have money to spend.

Pepe himself will cost any interested party a fee of around £70m, though Lille are thought to be keen to cash in on their star player who helped them finish second in Ligue 1 last term.
The Ivorian international, who was born in France, cost Lille just €10m when he joined from Angers in the summer of 2017.

After scoring 13 times in his first campaign with Lille, Pepe enjoyed an even more productive campaign last time out, but is set to move away from the French club this summer.
