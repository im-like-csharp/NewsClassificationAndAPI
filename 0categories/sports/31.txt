Man Utd ready to reward impressive youngster with bumper new deal
Manchester United are reportedly preparing a new deal for Mason Greenwood which would see the young star receive a hefty pay rise.

The 17-year-old has been in impressive form so far for United during preseason, scoring against both Leeds United and Inter Milan.

He seems set for a more prominent role with the first team in 2019-20, and the Red Devils are reportedly keen to tie him down to a new deal before his 18th birthday in October.

A report from The Sun claims that Greenwood currently earns just £800-a-week, though he is on a nice first team appearance bonus of around £5,000 per game.

He only signed his first professional contract last October, but has continued his development with United where he has been since he was just six years old.

An Old Trafford source apparently told The Sun: “He isn’t on an awful lot but does get bonuses on top for each appearance.

“Ole wants him to focus on his football at the moment and he is doing a terrific job of that.”

Greenwood is tipped to follow team-mate Marcus Rashford, who penned a new £20,000-a-week deal at the age of 18, and is now on around £300,000-a-week after he signed a new deal earlier in July
