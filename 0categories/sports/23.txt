Club have begun ‘initial negotiations’ to sign Manchester City player – Optimism building
The optimism in Germany is building over Bayern Munich having a serious chance to sign Leroy Sane from Manchester City this summer.

Bild have been reporting for months that Sane is a major target for the Bundesliga champions, but at one point they pretty much gave up.

There were all kinds of snipes sent the way of Sane and City. Bild said the footballer’s girlfriend and mother were involved in a power struggle, with the former wanting to stay in England and the latter preferring her son return to Germany.

It sounded like nonsense, as did other claims around the player about money and him being wary of media pressure in his home country. Any excuse for Bayern not to be seen as the losers.

Anyway, that’s all gone now and there’s sunshine on the Sane track. Pep Guardiola’s comments this week, about the player’s future being down to him, have been taken as something of a sign.

Bild report that Bayern’s sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic has been in ‘initial negotiations’ with Manchester City over the signing, and it’s something the club will continue to pursue.

There remains the possibility that Sane is letting all this continue so he can get better deal on a renewal, but that isn’t dampening Bayern enthusiasm.
