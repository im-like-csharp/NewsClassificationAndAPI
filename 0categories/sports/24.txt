The Magpies were in the stands for Hull's friendly defeat to Ligue 1 side Amiens
Newcastle United have taken a closer look at Sweden international Emil Krafth.

The Chronicle understands that the Magpies had talent spotters in the stands at the KCOM Stadium for Hull City's 2-0 friendly loss against French side Amiens.

Newcastle were also keeping tabs on Jarrod Bowen from Hull but took the opportunity to check out the Swedish defender.

Krafth is a 24-year-old right-back who is being considered to provide competition for US international DeAndre Yedlin.

United are spinning plates with just a fortnight of the window to go and have active enquiries for another four deals going on at the moment.

Krafth has three years left on his existing deal with Amiens and has previous experience in Serie A with Bologna and Helsingborgs.
After getting a £40million swoop for Joelinton over the line, Bruce wants defensive cover, a winger and another striker.

Bruce admitted he was keen on Nice winger Allan Saint-Maximin but United have not triggered the French club's £20million asking price yet.

He said: "I don’t think it’s on the verge of happening but it’s somebody we have looked at, it’s somebody we have identified and we will see what happens."
