Liverpool FC linked with shock swoop for Burnley star
Liverpool could be about to swoop to sign Burnley keeper Tom Heaton.

The Reds have been struggling for goalkeepers during pre-season, with free agent Andy Lonergan brought in as cover during the US tour.

Lonergan was used against Sevilla but Simon Mignolet started in goal in the 2-2 draw with Sporting on Wednesday night.

Alisson Becker is expected to be back for the Premier League kick-off following his return from Brazil’s Copa America camapign.

However, boss Jurgen Klopp is reportedly eyeing up Clarets and England keeper Heaton.

The 33-year-old is in the final 12 months of his contract at Turf Moor and Liverpool may look to sign him as cover, according to the Daily Mail, via the Daily Mirror.
However, they face competition from Aston Villa for Heaton’s signature.
Klopp says Liverpool “are still looking” in the transfer market this summer, but insists that he is perfectly happy with the team he has at his disposal.
“We are still looking, but it will not be the (biggest) transfer window of LFC,” the German told an exclusive interview with the Liverpool Echo.

“It just will be a transfer window.
“We will see what we do, and if we haven’t done anything by the end it will be for different reasons.

“It’s about using this team. In the transfer window, you have to build a team that you think you want to go into the season with. But I have that team already.
“If we can bring somebody else in that makes it even better, we will see. But if not, this team is already there. And again we will have to find solutions at different moments.”
