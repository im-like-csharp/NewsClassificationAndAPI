Manchester United vs Tottenham LIVE highlights and reaction after Angel Gomes, Lucas Moura and Anthony Martial score
Manchester United rounded off their 2019 pre-season tour with a 2-1 victory over Tottenham as Angel Gomes scored his first goal for the club.

The diminutive midfielder was one of 11 players Ole Gunnar Solskjaer introduced at half-time and his neat finish from a tight angle after a one-two with Juan Mata proved to be the game's winning goal.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men dominated the first half at the Hongkou Stadium and Anthony Martial put United in front in the 22nd minute having hit the post in the early stages of the match.

Tottenham equalised through a deflected Lucas Moura strike in the second half but Gomes' late strike ensured United concluded their pre-season tour with a 100 percent win record after earlier victories over Perth Glory, Leeds United and Inter Milan.

Solskjaer and his players are flying straight back to Manchester after the match ahead of further pre-season fixtures against Kristiansund and AC Milan.
