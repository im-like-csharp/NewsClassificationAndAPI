Aston Villa sign Manchester City midfielder
Aston Villa have completed a £15m deal for Manchester City midfielder Douglas Luiz subject to a work permit.

 

Luiz departs Manchester City without having made a competitive appearance for the club due to work permit issues.

 

Pep Guardiola’s side were denied a permit, much to their frustration, but Villa are confident of overcoming any such issues.
Luiz, 21, has spent the last two years on loan at Spanish side Girona as a result of not being eligible to play for City and made 38 league appearances. 

 

Villa started the summer with Leeds midfielder Kalvin Phillips in their sights but their £11m bid for the Championship ace was rejected.

 

After being stunned by Leeds’ £30m valuation, Dean Smith’s side have wrapped up a deal for Luiz to make him their eighth signing of the summer.

 

Of players that have attempted at least 25 dribbles since August 2017, Luiz has the best success rate (93.1%).
