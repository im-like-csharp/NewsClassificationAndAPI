mistrust lack genetic diversity slow gains precision medicine precision medicine field dreams human health drugs treatments take account person individual dna configurations lifestyle environment presumably better tailored person needs goal precision medicine help current research available major flaw largely based genes people predominantly white european descent issue implications ethically scientifically says anthropologist bioethicist sandra soo jin lee heads columbia university medical center new division ethics leading study funded national human genome research institute look precision medicine research academic medical centers help researchers figure ways expand diversity genetics data gathered lee wrote ethics personalized medicine research science magazine spoke
